The purpose of this folder is to save the docs that Kyle wrote for the STM32H5.
Rather than doing some weird git save with a branch, just put them here.

They will get added in a future PR for the H5. 

They were stored in nuttx/Documentation/platforms/arm/stm32h5

Do NOT include this file in the documentation folder.
